Hello all! Time for another update of **#1hikeaweek** (slowly catching up on the blogs). 

This week we went to a trail called [Escondido Falls Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/escondido-falls-trail). Apparently, this hike is famous and the bonus is that there is a waterfall at the end of the hike.

The reason we chose this hike because it was the first time that my roommate joined the hike so I didn't want to scare him away.

It was relatively a chill hike and this is what I saw at the waterfall

I have heard many good things about Escondido waterfall but boy I forgot the waterfall does dry up sometimes.

You must be thinking that I am done with the hike and time to go home but the answer is no because that is just too short of a hike.

Next up, we visited [Point Dume](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=623). Again, it is a famous place with an awesome view. A lot of people were at the beach but luckily we are at high ground so there were not as many people.

The view is amazing. Imagine closing your eyes hearing the laughter of the kids running around the beach, birds chirping, and the sound of the wave hitting the beach. I hope that I give you enough visual for you to realize that sometimes we don't have to follow the flow of the world.

Take a deep breath, close your eyes, and enjoy the moment. That's exactly what I did especially during the COVID time.

Another milestone that I reached was that I broke another record because my hair has never gotten so long. I looked like a Tarzan but the picture will be shelved for now.

With that, we conclude the **#1hikeaweek**. Until next time, **বিদায়**!

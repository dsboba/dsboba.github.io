Hello! Welcome back to another week of **#1hikeaweek**. Today, we are adventuring out to [Bane Canyon Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/bane-canyon-loop-trail) in Chino Hills state park.

The loop itself is a 5.8 miles and tagged as moderate by Alltrails. Before the hike, we are doing pre-hike eatery at [Fujin Ramen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/fujin-ramen-west-covina?osq=fujin+ramen). We got dumplings and the ramen as shown below.

The trail is in Chino Hills State Park and we have to walk a little to reach the trail since there's no direct parking at the trail.

It was raining a little in the morning before the hike so it was quite muddy. I remembered that I had to peel off the mud with a stick while hiking. As per usual, there are many kinds of flowers at the trail as shown below.

</tr></table>

Finally the views were amazing and there was no more than 7 people on the trail which made the hike much more relaxing.

After the hike, we went to one of the popular boba shop called [Omomo](https://www.omomoteashoppe.com) in Chino Hills. The shop is small but got a chic style to it. Being a big fan of matcha (green tea), I got the signature Omomo matcha and my friend got the strawberry flavor.

We cook our food again. Remember the spicy fish soup that I ate at Sichuan Kungfu Fish after [Sturtevant and Hermit Falls hike](https://dsboba.github.io/sturtevant-and-hermit-falls/)? One of my friends is trying to replicate it and honestly, it is not too far off and tasted great.

We were eating while watching the professional badminton tournament held in the United Kingdom called [Yonex All Englands](https://www.allenglandbadminton.com/).

With that, we conclude the weekly **#1hikeaweek** and 
**Auf Wiedersehen!**

Hello! Another hike with coworkers but we turned it up a notch to hike at [Beaudry Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/beaudry-loop). The length is 5.5 miles with 1515ft elevation gain and this place has little to no cover.

Before the hike, we pump some fuel into our bodies at [Tilt Coffee Bar](https://www.tiltcoffeebar.com/). Make sure to get their Cloud Mocha/Latte, this place has one of the most unique and delicious drink.

Now onto the hike, it was a hot day (make sure to check the weather, apply a lot of sunscreens, and bring lots of water). Although the elevation gain is relatively high compared to the length of the mile, the view along the way was mesmerizing.

Throughout the hike, we can see the view of the mountain and the city which was a nice mix. Is this place used to be a motorway? It has a satellite structure too which was pretty cool. It was so hot that we take a break whenever a shade is spotted.

With a long and arduous hike, we had to award ourselves with delicacy at [Ootoro](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ootoro-little-tokyo-los-angeles). Time to have some sushi!

If you visit Ootoro, I highly recommend getting anything that is fatty tuna related and I love spicy tuna hand roll.

We can't just end our adventure there so we topped it off with a fruit tea at a boba shop called [Milk + Tea](https://www.yelp.com/biz/milk-t-los-angeles-3). The cool thing about this place is that you can get unlimited topping and you get to keep the cup.

With that, we concluded our hike. Until next time!

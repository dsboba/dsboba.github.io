Back at it again with **#1hikeaweek**. On June 7th, my friends and I hiked at [Nike Hill](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/nike-hill). I thought this place somehow related to [Nike](https://www.nike.com/) but it is not.

It is rated as a moderate hike according to Alltrails with a length of 3.8 miles and 987 feet elevation again.

We got to see the city landscape, a factory (not sure what kind), and other miscellaneous stuff.

At the top of Nike hill, the view consists of the cool road landscape, the town nearby, and mountains.

After the hike, we stopped by a famous boba place called [Chicha San Chen](http://www.chichasanchensocal.com/) and got my drink there. It was one of the smoothest boba drinks I have ever had.

With that, we conclude the **#1hikeaweek**. Until next time, **ביי**!
